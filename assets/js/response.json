			"description": " Astounding technology is about to become commonplace, and it will change everything. Where radical advancements reconfigure the convergence between our humanity and the technology we wield, we may need to rethink our search for meaning, joy, profession, health and purpose. Our annual show will explore the pitfalls and promises of our technology-infused future. Nanotechnology and embedded sensors promise to augment our capabilities; blockchain and crypto-currencies could upend the ways we track ownership, distribute commodities, and manage wealth; gene science moves to rewrite the limitations of our heredity; immersive VR and telepresence redefines the real; and robotics, automation, and AI forces a hard rethink of jobs held by man and machine. From the molecular to the grand, the many new ways we’ll engage with technology are creating a changing experience of our very identity.<p>TEDxMarin 2018 will offer a big picture view of this emerging coexistence, and bring inspiration to our Bay Area community with thought-provoking insights and ideas how we’ll live, work and thrive in the world to come.</p>",
